#issues: add color to the board to distinuguish between white and black
# I want to get the functionality of moving an arbitrary piece to any other space
# and then do the same with multiple pieces on the board. Then I will deal with
# creating the different functionality of the different pieces.

# We might want to consider making each individual piece have a move(x,y) method.
